## Code Generation and Templates

IntelliJ IDEA offers powerful code generation features that can save you time and reduce boilerplate code.

### Live Templates

Live templates allow you to insert frequently-used code constructs quickly. Here are some useful ones:

- `psvm` + Tab: Creates a `public static void main(String[] args)` method
- `sout` + Tab: Inserts `System.out.println()`
- `fori` + Tab: Creates a for loop with index
- `iter` + Tab: Creates a for-each loop
- `psf` + Tab: Creates `public static final`
- `psfs` + Tab: Creates `public static final String`

You can also create your own live templates:

1. Go to Settings/Preferences → Editor → Live Templates
2. Click the "+" button to add a new template
3. Define the abbreviation, description, and template text
4. Specify the applicable contexts

### Generate Code

IntelliJ IDEA can generate common code structures for you:

1. Press `Alt+Insert` (Windows/Linux) or `⌘+N` (macOS)
2. Choose what to generate:
   - Constructor
   - Getter and Setter
   - equals() and hashCode()
   - toString()
   - Override methods
   - Implement methods
   - Delegate methods

### Postfix Completion

Postfix completion allows you to transform an expression by adding a suffix:

- `variable.if` → `if (variable) {}`
- `variable.null` → `if (variable == null) {}`
- `variable.notnull` → `if (variable != null) {}`
- `variable.for` → `for (Type item : variable) {}`
- `variable.fori` → `for (int i = 0; i < variable.length; i++) {}`
- `variable.nn` → `Objects.requireNonNull(variable)`
- `variable.var` → `Type variable = expression`
- `variable.new` → `new Type()`

## Smart Code Navigation
